# Calories Burn Prediction

## Overview

The Calories Burn Prediction project aims to predict the calories burned based on various features such as activity type, duration, heart rate, etc. It utilizes machine learning techniques to build a predictive model for estimating calories burned during physical activities.<br><br>
In this notebook, I applied different regression techniques to predict the data of calories burned in the exercises from the knowledge of duration (t), heart rate (h), body temperature (T), age (A), weight (W), height (H) and gender (G). It was verified that the variable that most influences the burning of calories is duration, followed by heart rate and body temperature. However, only with the considerations of all set of features that was possible to reduce the error to less than 1% of the mean.
